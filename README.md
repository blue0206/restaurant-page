# Restaurant Page

Site Link: https://blue0206.github.io/restaurant-page/

This project was a BIG step up! I learnt about so many advanced concepts
like Webpack & ES6 Modules and applied them in this project!

On the front-end side, this project wasn't much. Part of the reason was
because I'm running behind schedule and need to get internship so I'm
running through these projects.

On the script side, I nailed all the topics I learnt. I used Webpack
and ES6 Modules flawlessly.

Time is of essence and I need to move forward in curriculum ASAP. So
I'll be stopping here. Thanks for reading!
